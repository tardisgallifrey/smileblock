# Tardisgallifrey's base Forge/Minecraft Mod
## Blocks and Block Items

<p>This mod contains the minimal that is necessary to create 
a 1.19 Minecraft mod from Forge.  The mod will create and place a smiley 
block from the Luke Graham tutorial for 1.19.2.</p>

<p>It will also create and place a block called `sad_block` that uses 
effects such as `plantable` and `explosion` from Vanilla Blocks.</p>

<p>This mod is in accordance with Mojang, Microsoft, and Forge 
licensing as well as my own use of the MIT license.</p>

## Use at your own risk.

### Information left from original README

Mapping Names:
=============================
By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields 
in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license, if you do not agree with it you can change your mapping names to other crowdsourced names in your 
build.gradle. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MCPConfig/blob/master/Mojang.md
